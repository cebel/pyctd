Citation from `CTD website (about) <http://ctdbase.org/about/>`_ [04/27/2017]:
 "*CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures
 affect human health. It provides manually curated information about chemical–gene/protein interactions,
 chemical–disease and gene–disease relationships.
 These data are integrated with functional and pathway data to aid in development of hypotheses about the mechanisms
 underlying environmentally influenced diseases.*"
